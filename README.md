This is the solution for the exercise

    1. I have converted the input to json and saved it in a file save under /resources
    2. I have changed the data class provided by you so that creation date is a sting and not LocalDate, as there was a parsing issue from the json

    4. Output is {SATURDAY=6, MONDAY=17, SUNDAY=9}
